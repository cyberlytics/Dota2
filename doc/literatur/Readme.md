ABSTRACT
Non-verbal communication plays a large role in online competitive
multiplayer games, as team members attempt to coordinate
with each other without distraction to achieve victory.
Some games enable this communication through “pings,”
alerts that are easy to activate and provide auditory and visual
cues for teammates. In this paper, we review the literature
on gestures and non-verbal communication and, through an
empirical analysis of 84,489 players across 10,293 matches
in the popular game, League of Legends, illustrate ping use
in multiplayer games and test the impact of ping actions on
performance in teams. We show that the amount of pings depends
on player role and in-game activity and that pings by
players have a positive but concave relationship with player
performance. These findings demonstrate the importance of
non-verbal communication and interruption on the performance
of virtual team members. We conclude by discussing
the implications of these results for theorizing and designing
sociotechnical systems that rely on users to engage in synchronous,
collaborative work in shared visual spaces.

- Direct offensive actions like kills and assists had a positive relationship with pings in this trend. We surmised that pings used in a defensive manner — as a warning to avoid being killed by enemies — would have a negative relationship with bad performance (ie., deaths). However, surprisingly, deaths were positively related to pings.

https://doi.org/10.1145/2998181.2998185

ABSTRACT
Recent research has demonstrated that (a) groups can be
characterized by a collective intelligence (CI) factor that
measures their ability to perform together on a wide range
of different tasks, and (b) this factor can predict groups’
performance on other tasks in the future. The current study
examines whether these results translate into the world of
teams in competitive online video games where selforganized,
time-pressured, and intense collaboration occurs
purely online. In this study of teams playing the online
game League of Legends, we find that CI does, indeed,
predict the competitive performance of teams controlling
for the amount of time played as a team. We also find that
CI is positively correlated with the presence of a female
team member and with the team members’ average social
perceptiveness. Finally, unlike in prior studies, tacit
coordination in this setting plays a larger role than verbal
communication.

- teams’ average social perceptiveness
- proportion of female members
were significant and positive predictors of CI.

Future research should examine why lasting teams in League were better able to reap the benefit of CI to actual performance than temporary teams.

CI is positively correlated with the presence of a female team member and with the team members’ average social perceptiveness.

Finally, unlike in prior studies, tacit coordination in this setting plays a larger role than verbal communication.

Abstract
With the development of computer science and Internet technology, online games
have become one of the most important sources of entertainment in daily life.
Meanwhile, increasing attention has been paid to top international electronic sports
(eSports) tournaments in which competitive pressure is becoming increasingly more
serious. Therefore, how to win such games is a problem worth exploring. This
article proposes a set of evaluation indicators for testing gameplay in Defense of the
Ancients 2, which is a popular multiplayer online game. The analysis shows that the
multiplayer killing indicator is an effective predictor of the game result. Furthermore,
the evaluation indicators are divided into two categories: operational skills and
tactical awareness. The functions of the indicators in each category are discussed.
The results show that, for professional eSports teams, tactical awareness affects the
multiplayer killing indicator and the game result more so than operational skills.

Professional eSports teams, tactical awareness affects the
multiplayer killing indicator and the game result more so than operational skills.

The results show that kills by multiple players is an effective predictor that relates to outcomes of Dota 2.

Combined impact of kills by multiple players and other tactical indicators that are closely related to kills by multiple players such as using observer wards, activating runes, and initiating fights.

## 2018_Lan_Predicting_WinLoss_Outcome_In_MOBA_Games.pdf

Abstract. Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game is currently
one of the most popular genres of online games. In a MOBA game,
players in a team compete against an opposing team. Typically, each
MOBA game is a larger battle composed of a series of combat events.
During a combat, the behavior of each player varies and the outcome
of a game is determined both by the variation of each player’s behavior
and by the interactions within each instance of combat. However, both
the variation and interaction are highly dynamic and difficult to master,
making it hard to predict the outcome of a game. In this paper, we
present a player behavior model (called pb-model). The model allows
us to predict the result of a game once we have collected enough data
on the behaviour of the players. We first use convolution to extract the
features of player behavior variation in each combat and model them as
sequences by time. Then we use a recurrent neural network to process
the interaction among these sequences. Finally, we combine these two
structures in a network to predict the result of a game. Experiments
performed on typical MOBA game dataset verify that our pb-model is
effective and achieves as high as 87.85% prediction accuracy.

(i) The win-loss outcome of the first 3 combats will not influence the outcome
of a game. It is determined by the interaction of all combats rather than by
any sole combat.
(ii) We used 4 behaviors in “First 20” and got an accuracy of prediction of
87.85%, which shows the high accuracy of our pb-model. Besides, the pbmodel
can be universally applied to all MOBA games, because the behaviors
and combats produced in all MOBA games are easy to get.

## 2019_Leiman_Herner_How_does_toxicity_change_depending_on_rank_in_LoL

Abstract This thesis aims to investigate toxic remarks in three different ranks in League of Legends, Bronze, Gold, and Diamond. The purpose is to understand how toxic communication between players would change depending on rank. A framework from Neto, Alvino and Becker (2018) was adopted to define and count toxic remarks. The method relied on participant observation to gather data; three different ranks were specified for data collection. Fifteen games were played in each of the ranks; Bronze, Gold, and Diamond. Each game was recorded, transcribed and analyzed by dividing each toxic remark registered into Neto, Alvino and Becker’s predetermined categories. The study concluded that domain language is more often used by players with a higher rank, meaning that high ranked players tend to use toxicity that requires previous game knowledge to understand. On the contrary, low ranked players tend to stick to basic complaints and insults when using toxicity to remark teammates while playing.

Key words: Toxic Remark, Toxicity, Domain Language, Domain Knowledge, Spam.

```
Diamond rank has a higher frequency of toxic remarks (101) compared to the other two researched ranks, Bronze (83), and Gold (84).

(SP: Ist n wirklich groß genug????)

It was found that there is direct link between player expertise and the use of domain language when using toxic remarks directed at other players. Bronze players tend to use complaints and insults when remarking their teammates while Gold players tend to use a wider spread of toxic remarks.

Summary
Just as they did with traditional sports, the collection, analysis, and use of all kinds of data are starting to change the way that online competitive games are played and concepted. Nowadays, as the E-sports have become more and more popular, data analyses on E-sports games have also become much more common.

In this project, I chose the famous online game League of Legends (LoL), developed by Riot Games in 2009, as a case study. The main reason is that I had played and enjoyed the game since its 5th season and would like to bring a more informed view to this project than I would with another case study. An other important motivational point was the Riot Games’ API, which allows the public to easily make queries and pull information from their servers.
